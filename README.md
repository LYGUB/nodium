# Manual

## Running

To get this project running, do the following

* Download the project (obviously)
* Get a Neo4j database running (locally, for now). This can be an empty database
* Open `index.html` in the root folder, preferably in Chrome

You are now able to directly modify the contents of your Neo4j database.

## Using

A short guide of the default actions

To create a node, press and hold the left mouse button anywhere on the canvas.

To select (and modify) a node, click it. The edit panel will open on the right.

To link nodes, drag them over each other.
